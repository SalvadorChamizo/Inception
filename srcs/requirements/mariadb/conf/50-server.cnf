###   MARIADB CONFIGURATION FILE

# In MariaDB, words that appear between brackets [] are called
# sections.

# These sections help organize and categorize configuration settings
# based on their relevance to specific parts of the MariaDB server or its components.

###   [server] SECTION

# This section is used for options that apply to the MariaDB server in
# general, both for standalone and embedded configurations.

[server]

# This section might be empty or include options that apply globally
# to the MariaDB server process.

# In this case it is empty.

###   [mysqld] SECTION

# This section is for settings that specifically apply to the MariaDB
# server daemon (mysqld), which is the process that runs the MariaDB
# database engine.

[mysqld]

# Any configuration under this section will directly affect how the
# database server behaves (e.g., memory usage, connections, logging).


# This specifies the system user that the MariaDB server will run as.
# By defaylt, MariaDB runs as the mysql user for security reasons.
# This user should have limited permissions to reduce risks.
user                    = mysql
# It's still considered good practice to explicitly define the user.


# This specifies the directory where the MariaDB database files are stored.
# The datadir is one of the most critical configurations for
# performance and reliability.
datadir                 = /var/lib/mysql
# Ensure that the datadir is located on a partition with sufficient
# space and performance. Use a dedicated disk for data storage if possible.


# This controls which IP address the MariaDB server will listen to
# for incoming connections. By default, it may be set to 127.0.0.1
# (localhost), which limits connections to the local machine.
bind-address = ::
# This project involves multiple containers, so we need to allow connections
# to MariaDB from other containers in the network. Setting bind-address = *
# or bind-address = 0.0.0.0 allows MariaDB to accept connections from any
# container or service, regardless of its IP address.
# If you use bind-address = 0.0.0.0 you are just allowing IPv4, and if
# you use bind-address = *, it will use IPv4 or IPv4 and IPv6 depending of
# the system configuration. If you want to specify to work always with IPv4
# and IPv6 if it's possible, you should use bind-address = ::


pid-file                = /run/mysqld/mysqld.pid

skip-external-locking

# Broken reverse DNS slows down connections considerably and name resolve is
# safe to skip if there are no "host by domain name" access grants
#skip-name-resolve

# Instead of skip-networking the default is now to listen only on
# localhost which is more compatible and is not less secure.
bind-address            = 127.0.0.1

# * Fine Tuning

#key_buffer_size        = 128M
#max_allowed_packet     = 1G
#thread_stack           = 192K
#thread_cache_size      = 8
# This replaces the startup script and checks MyISAM tables if needed
# the first time they are touched
#myisam_recover_options = BACKUP
#max_connections        = 100
#table_cache            = 64

#
# * Logging and Replication
#

# Both location gets rotated by the cronjob.
# Be aware that this log type is a performance killer.
# Recommend only changing this at runtime for short testing periods if needed!
#general_log_file       = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log
#general_log            = 1

# When running under systemd, error logging goes via stdout/stderr to journald
# and when running legacy init error logging goes to syslog due to
# /etc/mysql/conf.d/mariadb.conf.d/50-mysqld_safe.cnf
# Enable this if you want to have error logging into a separate file
#log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
# Enable the slow query log to see queries with especially long duration
#slow_query_log_file    = /var/log/mysql/mariadb-slow.log
#long_query_time        = 10
#log_slow_verbosity     = query_plan,explain
#log-queries-not-using-indexes
#min_examined_row_limit = 1000

# The following can be used as easy to replay backup logs or for replication.
# note: if you are setting up a replication slave, see README.Debian about
#       other settings you may need to change.
#server-id              = 1
#log_bin                = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log
expire_logs_days        = 10
#max_binlog_size        = 100M

# * SSL/TLS
#

# For documentation, please read
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/securing-connections-for-client-and-server/
#ssl-ca = /etc/mysql/cacert.pem
#ssl-cert = /etc/mysql/server-cert.pem

#
# * Character sets
#

# MySQL/MariaDB default is Latin1, but in Debian we rather default to the full
# utf8 4-byte character set. See also client.cnf
character-set-server  = utf8mb4
collation-server      = utf8mb4_general_ci

#
# * InnoDB
#

# InnoDB is enabled by default with a 10MB datafile in /var/lib/mysql/.
# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!
# Most important is to give InnoDB 80 % of the system RAM for buffer use:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-system-variables/#innodb_buffer_pool_size
#innodb_buffer_pool_size = 8G

# this is only for embedded server
[embedded]

# This group is only read by MariaDB servers, not by MySQL.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MySQL and MariaDB,
# you can put MariaDB-only options here
[mariadb]

# This group is only read by MariaDB-10.5 servers.
# If you use the same .cnf file for MariaDB of different versions,
# use this group for options that older servers don't understand
[mariadb-10.5]
